### Features
* **Filename independent**  
SubGenesis uses the file hash of the video file instead of the filename to request the SubDB API. No matter what you name the video file, SubGenesis will fetch the right subtitle for you.  
* **Multi Platform**   
As of now SubGenesis runs on Windows and MacOS. Future builds for Linux, Android and iOS can be expected.
* **Totally Free**  
SubGenesis is free, and will always be. Yeah, no ads
